* Plots produced for the above paper for the Aurorasaurus data during March 17-18, 2015 geomagnetic storm. The “conjunction_observations.csv” file includes all the reports (twitter, positive reports, and negative reports) that were used in analysis along with the information when the report stated overhead, north, etc. There is a header for each report which tells you which satellite pass they were matched with. The folder “SSUSI_ovation_aurorasaurus_plots” includes FUV plots from DMSP satellites F16,F17, and F18, OVATION Prime model output along with model boundaries.
